# README Generator
  

  ## Description
  
  The README Generator is a Node.js application that allows the user to quickly create a README by accepting user responses to prompts and structuring it in a markdown file, following general README best practices. With the exeption of the video, this README was created using this project. The app prompts the user for information about the project, including contact info, project name, description, licensing detail, and test/use/collaboration instruction.

  ## Usage
  
  Must have Node.js installed, and understand how to use node, terminal, and a code editor. To use this project, first make sure you are familiar with node, CLIs, and terminals, and also first have the inquirer node module installed (command script above). Using the terminal/CLI, you navigate into the same folder that the index.js is located. This is essential so that node is able to find the file the code will run from. Start with "node index". From there, you will be prompted a series of questions, with answer submission indicated via key press of the "return" key. Once all the questions are answered, a file will be automatically created named "README.md" in the same folder. This is your completed, formatted README.
